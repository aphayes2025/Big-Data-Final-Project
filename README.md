Abstract


I used football game logs from four NFL seasons (2019-2022) to create a machine learning model that would predict the outcome of a game. I used data visualizations to help me figure out the relationships between my features and predictions. I then trained a feed forward neural network model to then predict the winner of each game. The model successfully predicted 60% of the games correctly.
